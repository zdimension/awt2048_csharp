# 2048 game using AWT in C#

This is a port of [awt2048](https://github.com/zdimension/awt2048) that uses the Visual J# standard library to pretty much directly port the original Java code to C#.

It's quite impressive how Microsoft managed to port AWT to the .NET Framework; most of the code was translated 1:1 from Java and almost no API call had to be changed for the game to work.

It's sad that J# was abandoned, because as such the last version of the library only supports old Java features (no generic types, for example).
